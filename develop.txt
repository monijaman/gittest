Epic Zero: Tales of a Not-So-Super 6th Grader, Book One is an adventure tale for children and preteens written by R.L. Ullman. It's yet another birthday filled with disappointment for Elliott Harkness. Just like every birthday before this, he has not woken up with a single meta improvement, no amplification of his memory or strength, not even the most modest super power. Why, in a family of superheroes, is he the one who gets to be an epic nothing? As his family thinks he's getting ready for school, Elliott goes through the familiar and depressing annual routine of checking for flight, morphing ability, speed and strength with sadly predictable results. Belonging to a family that's a key part of the Freedom Force team should be exciting, but not for him. While Meta 3 power is awesome and the best there is, Elliott would be thrilled with even a bit of Meta 1 abilities and with the least exciting meta skill, but he remains a very unextraordinary twelve-year-old and most definitely a Meta Zero. His family did remember his birthday this year at least, but before he could even make a wish, they were off to fight crime, and he was stuck going to middle school.

R.L. Ullman's adventure tale for children and preteens, Epic Zero: Tales of a Not-So-Super 6th Grader, Book One, is an awesome and inspirational coming of age story filled with superheroes, arch villains and lots of action. My sympathy for the very normal Elliott was heightened when he discusses his mother's psychic abilities, and I suppressed a slight shudder at the thought of a parent who could literally read minds. This inventive story feels a lot like a graphic novel with marvelous illustrations of superheroes and villains. Ullman's meta heroes are fabulous, and the glossary at the back of the book detailing Meta Powers and Meta Profile Characteristics helps bring it all together. I was pleased to discover that this is book one in a series and am looking forward to the next installment. Epic Zero: Tales of a Not-So-Super 6th Grader, Book One is most highly recommended.
